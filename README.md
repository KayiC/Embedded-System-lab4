# Lab4
This lab project is working on the transition of the LED colours between two patterns (Pattern A and Pattern B), and the transitions occur smoothly, with brightness levels increasing and decreasing depended on the timing.

- Pattern A:
  - Start with red full on
  - Increase the blue and decrease the red
  - Blue full on
  - Increase the green and decrease the blue
  - Green full on
  - Increase the red and decrease the green
  - Red full on, return to the starting state

- Pattern B:
  - Start with all colour off
  - Red and blue full on
  - Red and green full on
  - Green and blue full on, return to the starting state

- Timing (Press B1 button to control the timing):
  - Start with Slow (9s)
  - if pressed, turn to Medium (5s)
  - if pressed again, turn to Fast (2s)
  - and again, return to Slow
  
- Transition between patterns (Press B2 button to switch the pattern):
  - Start with Pattern A
  - if pressed, switch to Pattern B
  - if pressed again, switch back to Pattern A
